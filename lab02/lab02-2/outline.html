            <strong>Weekly quizzes:</strong> are short online quizzes completed at the beginning of your tutorial. See the Schedule above for the topics and dates of these quizzes. In general they cover the material from the previous lectures and are closed book. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Lab exercises:</strong> in the tutorial your tutor will review the completion of your completed lab exercises. You are encourage to attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so you have time to discuss any issues that arise with you tutor and have time to get them marked off. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Assignments:</strong> Parts 1, 2 and 3: are incremental instalments of a web site development task. In Part 1 you will demonstrate your ability to develop and deploy on a server well-structured, linked Web pages with text, graphics, tables and forms, styled with CSS. Part 2 further extends the use of HTML elements and makes use of JavaScript to validate forms and add dynamic behaviour to the Web page. In Part 3 you will use forms to submit and retrieve data from a server using PHP and MySQL. <br />
